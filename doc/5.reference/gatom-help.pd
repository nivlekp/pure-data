numbers using the mouse and keyboard. When a number arrives at the
number box's inlet \, it is displayed and sent to the outlet. You can
click on a number box and drag upward or downward to change the value
continuously., f 60;

number - BUT BEWARE \, THIS IS EXPENSIVE IN CPU TIME. In a production
patch \, you'll want to set a specific width., f 64;
